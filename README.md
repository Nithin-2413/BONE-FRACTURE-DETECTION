# BONE-FRACTURE-DETECTION
The Automated Bone Fracture Detection project utilizes hybrid deep neural models to accurately classify bone fractures from X-ray images. By combining MedNet and CNN architectures, the model achieves high precision and reduced training time. The dataset includes both fractured and non-fractured images, ensuring comprehensive training.
